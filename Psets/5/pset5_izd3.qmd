**a)**

**b)**

In this case, since there are three spaces and three promoters, each advertiser gets a space in any case. Hence, no advertiser causes any hurt to others by partaking in the sell-off. Hence, all advertisers pay a cost of zero in this VCG Method.

**2.**

**a)**

Buyer Y would win the auction and will pay the price of 8

**b.)**

-   Buyer y takes A 10

Prices:

-   Buyer y: =8

-   Buyer x and z does not receive any items

If y wasn't in the auction, the item would have gone to x who would pay 8, so y pays the harm which would be 8.

**a.)** ![fig2](fig2.jpg)

**b.)**

These prices are similar because they all do equally as much harm, the true culprit of this however is buy z which has a value of 4 across all the items, so whenever we take the harm price z always ends up making all the values go to 4

**4.**

**a)**

-   X will take slot A at 25

-   Y will take slot B at 12

-   Z will take Slot C at 6

Prices:

-   Advertiser x pays (15+8)-(12+6)=23-18=5

-   Advertiser y pays (25+8)-(25+6)=33-31=2

-   Advertiser z pays (25+12)-(25+12)=37-37=0

**b.)**

1.  Advertiser w would be assigned to slot D as it causes the least amount of harm

Advertiser x cannot precisely determine the value of v based on the information provided. Advertiser x knows that advertiser w has the smallest value per click but doesn't have enough information to determine the exact value. Advertiser x only knows they are paying 3 more for slot a compared to their initial allocation in part (a), but this doesn't provide enough information to deduce the precise value of v.

**5.)**

**a)**

In this generalized second price auction, it is not a Nash equilibrium for each advertiser to bid their true value per click. Let's consider the bids as described:

-   Advertiser x bids 10 per click.

-   Advertiser y bids 9 per click.

-   Advertiser z bids 6 per click.

So, it is a Nash equilibrium as each advertiser has no benefit from deviating from bidding their true value. X has the highest bid value possible so in essence, they would always bid their max as they are guaranteed to win and pay a price lower than their true value. Y should always bid 9 as it's guaranteed to at least pay the third highest bid, they would only lose or win by 1 when competing with x but if they obtain slot B, they would be making a profit of 3 guaranteed from Z.

**b.)**

No, it is not a Nash equilibrium because:

-   Advertiser x can benefit from deviating and bidding 10 per click instead of 9. This way, they will still get slot A but pay a lower price (6 per click), increasing their utility

**c.)**

it is a Nash equilibrium because:

-   Advertiser x cannot benefit from deviating. Bidding higher would increase their cost, and they cannot secure a better slot (they already have slot a).

-   Advertiser y cannot benefit from deviating. Bidding higher would increase their cost, and they cannot secure a better slot (they already have slot b).

-   Advertiser z cannot benefit from deviating. Bidding higher would increase their cost, and they cannot secure a better slot (they already have slot c).

In this case, no advertiser can improve their outcome by deviating, so the proposed bids form a Nash equilibrium.
