1.)

Bettor 1:

$$
\frac{1}{2}ln(r)+(1-\frac{1}{2})ln(r-1)
$$

$$
\frac{1}{3r}-\frac{2}{3(1-r)}=0
$$

$$
r=\frac{1}{3}
$$

therefore the maximum bettor 1 should do is

$$
\frac{1}{3}*3000=1000
$$

Bettor 2:

$$
\frac{1}{3}ln(r)+(1-\frac{1}{3})ln(r-1)
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2r}-\frac{2}{2(1-r)}=0
$$

$$
r=\frac{1}{2}
$$

therefore the maximum bettor 2 should do is

$$
\frac{1}{2}*4000=2000
$$

Bettor 3:

$$
\frac{2}{3}ln(r)+(1-\frac{2}{3})ln(r-1)
$$

$$
\frac{2}{3r}-\frac{1}{3(1-r)}=0
$$

$$
r=\frac{2}{3}
$$

therefore the maximum bettor 3 should do is

$$
\frac{2}{3}*9000=6000
$$

b.)

Inverse odds

$$
\frac{1000+6000+2000}{3000+4000+9000}
$$

$$
\frac{1+6+2}{3+4+9}=\frac{9}{2+2+3}=\frac{9}{16}
$$

What this means is that the market has some uncertainty among the participants as to which horse would win as the value falls between the values of the three bettors.
